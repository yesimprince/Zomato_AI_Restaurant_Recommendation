Problem Statement: AI-Powered Restaurant Recommendation System (Zomato Use Case)
You are tasked with building an AI-powered restaurant recommendation service inspired by Zomato. The system should intelligently suggest restaurants based on user preferences by combining structured data with a Large Language Model (LLM).
Objective
Design and implement an application that:
Takes user preferences (such as location, budget, cuisine, and ratings)
Uses a real-world dataset of restaurants
Leverages an LLM to generate personalized, human-like recommendations
Displays clear and useful results to the user
System Workflow
Data Ingestion
Load and preprocess the Zomato dataset from Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/datasets/ManikaSaini/zomato-restaurant-recommendation )
Extract relevant fields such as restaurant name, location, cuisine, cost, rating, etc.
User Input
Collect user preferences:
Location (e.g., Delhi, Bangalore)
Budget (low, medium, high)
Cuisine (e.g., Italian, Chinese)
Minimum rating
Any additional preferences (e.g., family-friendly, quick service)
Integration Layer
Filter and prepare relevant restaurant data based on user input
Pass structured results into an LLM prompt
Design a prompt that helps the LLM reason and rank options
Recommendation Engine
Use the LLM to:
Rank restaurants
Provide explanations (why each recommendation fits)
Optionally summarize choices
Output Display
Present top recommendations in a user-friendly format:
Restaurant Name
Cuisine
Rating
Estimated Cost
AI-generated explanation
